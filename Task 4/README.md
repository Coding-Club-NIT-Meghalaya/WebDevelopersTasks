## 📝📝 **  TODO LIST** 📝📝
_The task is all about making a Todo-list using javascript. It works only for those instructions which were pre-set by the developer. The website is controlled from the prompt window and the changes can only be noticed in the console window. List consists of features like "new" - for adding a new task to the list, "list" - for  displaying the list and "quit" - to quit app and the prompt window. ._
