#### How to do it ? 

1. Create a web page with html, css, js files etc. keeping in mind the task name and making sure you are implementing what is being asked (That's something for you to figure out!).
2. Put them in a folder with your name in the format: ``FirstName_SecondName_Task6``
    For example: ``John_Doe_Task6``
3. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/Coding-Club-NIT-Meghalaya/WebDevelopersTasks) and add your folder in the Task6 folder and push your changes to the main branch as a pull request.
4. If you don't want to follow step 3 and have already forked a copy of the repo to your own account, you may clone ([How to clone?](https://github.com/Coding-Club-NIT-Meghalaya/WebDevelopersTasks#readme)) your own repo and commit the changes in **your** repo and create a pull request (and hope that your pull request is accepted and merged).
5. Don't forget to give yourself a pat on the back. If you've reached this step, you did great!
