#### How to do it ? 

1. Create a web page containing a guessing game (a sample included) which involves selecting all the right pair of images by flipping them one at a time. Clone this repo and open the [index.html]() file in Task6/sample/code to know how it is to be made. You may even include other new features like points or a timer etc. to make it more interesting. Keep in mind the task name and make sure you are implementing what is being asked.

2. Put them in a folder with your name in the format: ``FirstName_SecondName_Task6``
    For example: ``John_Doe_Task6``
3. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/Coding-Club-NIT-Meghalaya/WebDevelopersTasks) and add your folder in the Task6 folder and push your changes to the main branch as a pull request.
4. If you don't want to follow step 3 and have already forked a copy of the repo to your own account, you may clone ([How to clone?](https://github.com/Coding-Club-NIT-Meghalaya/WebDevelopersTasks#readme)) your own repo and commit the changes in **your** repo and create a pull request (and hope that your pull request is accepted and merged).
5. Don't forget to give yourself a pat on the back. If you've reached this step, you did great!
